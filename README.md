## Developed Theme  
### My First Major WordPress Theme Project

This project is my first large-scale WordPress theme and the biggest one I’ve worked on so far.

The theme was built from scratch with a strong focus on accessibility and performance, following **WCAG 2.1 AA** guidelines. The aim was to create a reusable base theme that could be adapted for future websites, with most changes handled through styling rather than rewriting functionality.

## Features

- WCAG AA–compliant theme structure
- Semantic and accessible HTML
- Keyboard navigation across menus and interactive elements
- ARIA attributes added where required
- High-contrast, readable CSS styles

### Custom Admin Menu Options (PHP)
- Theme-specific settings added to the WordPress admin
- Allows content and layout control without relying on plugins

### Mega Menu
- Responsive mega menu built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript
- Fully keyboard accessible
- Designed to work with screen readers

Main files related to the mega menu:
